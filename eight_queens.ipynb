    "8-Queens Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The eight queens problem was first proposed by Max Bezzel in the Berliner Schachzeitung (1848) and first fully solved by Franz Nauck in Leipziger Illustrierte Zeitung (1850). It asks in how many ways eight queens can be placed on a chess board so that no two attack each other. Each of the twelve solutions shown on this page represents an equivalence class of solutions resulting from each other by rotating the chessboard and/or flipping it along one of its axes of symmetry. \n",
    "\n",
    "The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard such that none of them is able to capture any other using the standard chess queen's moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The queens must be placed in such a way that no two queens would be able to attack each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. The eight queens puzzle is an example of the more general n  queens puzzle of placing n queens on an n×n chessboard for n ≥ 4."
